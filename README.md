Using Arduino and Nodemcu(esp8266) 
We read temperature and humidity from DHT11 sensor with the help of ardunio uno and send that data to nodemcu with the help of serial communication by the help of Software Serial library and upload that data to firebase by the help of nodemcu.
connect 5TH pin of arduino uno and D5 pin of nodemcu
connect 6TH pin of arduino uno and D6 pin of nodemcu
